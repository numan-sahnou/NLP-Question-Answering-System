# NLP-Question-Answering-System
NLP Project on SQuAD dataset from Stanford University

Question answering a field of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP) concerned with building automated systems which answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. There are 2 types of systems; Closed-Domain QA and Open-Domain QA. 

Closed-Domain QA is about building systems that answer questions from a specific domain. So, given a piece of text, we hope to develop systems capable of answering questions from that specific text.  

Open-Domain QA deals with questions about nearly anything, and can rely on general ontologies and world knowledge. These systems usually have much more data available from which to extract the answer. 

In this task, we are concerned with closed-domain QA. 

Types of Questions in modern systems: 

* Factoid questions: Where is the Louvre Museum located? 

* Complex questions: What do scholars think about Jeffersonâ€™s posi4on on dealing with pirates? 

We are interested in Factoid questions in this task. 

I created an automated closed-domain QA system capable of providing correct and intelligeable answers to human questions regarding a provided piece of text. 

The final model shoud be given a paragraph, and a question about that paragraph, as input. The goal is to answer the question correctly
